= Meeting with RW =
Had a meeting about CurveTrader along with CG, SS.
We agreed that the CurveTrade implementation in eptstrat would be blackbox. In general we are focussing on automating the trading to reduce the requirement for traders to be permanently tied up trading the books.

There was a follow up meeting between RW and myself where he asked me to run the CurveTrader project. I agreed that it would be a good idea. He said a number of interesting things:
* ASAP has turned average traders into excellent revenue generators
* Book 16 made half of PT's money in 2015 Q1 (~$1.25m)
* Blackbox approach would mean that it's more likely that new teams would be brought into the company which only benefits MH
* Algo assisted manual trading has formed the stable backbone of Epoch (and Rolls has been a very nice, albeit fragile, bonus)
* Epoch is committed to writing market access for those markets that we're interested in
* Work is still being done on forumulating a company vision, with Alison West
