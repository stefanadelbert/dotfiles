= LUKS =

This is a good reference for the typical use case: http://elephly.net/posts/2013-10-01-dm-crypt.html 

== Open an existing LUKS container ==

[[{{{]]
sudo crypesetup luksOpen <container image> <nickname>
sudo mount /dev/mapper/<nickname> <mount point>
}}}

Make sure that `<mount point>` has the correct permissions. If it doesn't then the container would be mounted read-only.

== Close an open container ==

{{{
sudo umount ~/my-mount-point
sudo cryptsetup luksClose secret-device
}}}
