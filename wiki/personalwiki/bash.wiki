= read =
Use this construct to read space separated values from a variable into other variables. This is kind of like unpacking in python.

{{{
while read VAR1 VAR2 VAR3; do
	echo ${VAR1} ${VAR2} ${VAR3}
done < ${DATA}
}}}

= tuple =
To iterate over a list of tuples, you could do something like this:

{{{
TUPLES="a:b c:d e:f"
IFS=' '
for TUPLE in ${TUPLES}; do
	IFS=':'
	set ${TUPLE}
	FIRST=$1
	SECOND=$2
done
}}}

This is convenient when pulling a list of tuples from a config file.

Another approach is to have a line per tuple and use read. See above.

= globbing =
== ignoring ==
Use this to ignore specific files from a glob.

`GLOBIGNORE=.config`
