= Searching, regex =

== Multi-line searching ==

To match over multiple lines, you can use the special `\_` style operators.

\_s:: a whitespace (space or tab) or newline character
\_^:: the beginning of a line (zero width)
\_$:: the end of a line (zero width)
\_.:: any character including a newline

== multis ==

The `*` multi will greedily match multiple characters. The `\{-}` multi will find the shortest match.

So, for `ababa`
* `.*a` will match `ababa`
* `.\{-}a` will match `aba`
