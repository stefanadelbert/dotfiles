Called to ask about the next step in starting the pre-approval again.

AJ put me throught to Loan Variations, on hold for 10mins.

Spoke to Min. He advised that they need new payslips, recent rates notice and a new cover letter. He said they don't do bank cheques, so a deposit would need to be paid by direct transfer. This would cost $50 unless the agent account is linked to ours, which would mean that we could do an internet transfer on the spot. The bank could also write a letter to confirm that we have the funds available. 

He said that we would need to get the details in quickly so that next week could be used for the pre-approval process. Timing would be tight. I should submit the application and then call to make sure that it's been received and is being processed.
