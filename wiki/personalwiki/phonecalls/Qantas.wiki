Spoke to some one about paying for the ticket that Cath had booked. The credit card had been declined apparently. I tried with my credit card details and it appears as if everything has gone through OK.

Tried to call back, but the wait queue was longer than 10mins, so gave up. Checked online and it looks like the booking hasn't been cancelled and the credit card has been debited.
