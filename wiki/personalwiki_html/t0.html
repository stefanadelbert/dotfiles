<h1 id="toc_2">Code</h1>
<p>
Get code building.
There will be a bin directory, along with python programs.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_2.1">Data</h2>

<ul>
<li>
unzip

</ul>
<p>
<code>$ ../bin/isplit &lt;data_file&gt; - this gives a file per day in the SFE binary format</code>
<code>$ ../bin/icat &lt;itch_file&gt; - human readable representation</code>
</p>

<p>
The above two tools have nothing to do with t0. They are just a representation of the ITCH format.
Tools with <em>i</em> in front are for itch files.
</p>

<p>
To convert ITCH files into t0 format, use <code>i2t</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>$ ../bin/i2t &lt;itch_file&gt; &lt;t0_output_file&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
To print the t0 files, use <code>tcat</code>
<code>$ ../bin/tcat &lt;t0_file&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>tcat</code> uses std::locale and facets to augment streams to provide additional information, such as timezones and contract symbols. This effectively adds lookup tables to the stream.
boost timezone stuff is broken. Really a database of dates is required. t0 uses tzinfo, same as python. See src/lib/time_stamp.h.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_2.2">Inferred Trades</h2>
<p>
Trade inference for front month bills requires market data for all other interest rates futures, including bonds.
Trying to get to a point where we have inferred trades for all instruments, then we can work with a specific one, like front bills.
To do this,
<code>$ ../bin/tinfer &lt;t0_file&gt; &lt;t0_output_file&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
This might give check failures, but it's toleratn fo those failures. For instance, if a real order matches against an implied order, then some trades in the implied product might be missed.
This gives a file with data and interleaved inferred trads.
</p>

<p>
Now need to isolate a single instrument.
</p>

<p>
<code>./bin/filter_contract IR 2013 6 &lt;t0_trade_file&gt; &lt;t0_output_file&gt;</code>
This is then the data specific to IRM3. tcat it and check.
There will be an inferred trade for each executed trade (OrderExecuted). OrderExecuted has the side of the passive order, Inferred trade message doesn't.
The idea here is that the inferred trades are done beforehand and then simulator then doesn't need to worry about it.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_2.3">Generating a Strategy Tree</h2>

<p>
A _tap_and_scratch_ tree represents all the possible actions that could have been taken for one entry order. All possible entry orders are determined on the open from level 3 data. If there are 100 working orders on the open, then there will initially be 100 trees. As new orders are added, new strategy trees are created for them.
</p>

<p>
<code>.bin/stree &lt;t0_file&gt; &lt;t0_output_file&gt; IRM3 0</code>
</p>

<p>
The 0 on the end will do everything. Put a 1 on the end and it will only do one tree. 1 is the default.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_2.4">Analyse the Trees</h2>

<p>
<code>./bin/analyse_decisions &lt;t0_tree_file&gt;</code>
</p>

<h3 id="toc_2.4.1">Tap and Scratch</h3>

<p>
Two parameters, entry lean and exit lean.
Create a universe of parameters sets and then work out how each of those parameters sets performs. Do this by using <code>analyse_decisions</code> which finds the max PNL for each parameter set.
