Called to ask about the next step in starting the pre-approval again.
</p>

<p>
AJ put me throught to Loan Variations, on hold for 10mins.
</p>

<p>
Spoke to Min. He advised that they need new payslips, recent rates notice and a new cover letter. He said they don't do bank cheques, so a deposit would need to be paid by direct transfer. This would cost $50 unless the agent account is linked to ours, which would mean that we could do an internet transfer on the spot. The bank could also write a letter to confirm that we have the funds available. 
</p>

<p>
He said that we would need to get the details in quickly so that next week could be used for the pre-approval process. Timing would be tight. I should submit the application and then call to make sure that it's been received and is being processed.
